        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">1. The FareShare Platform</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">
          The FareShare Platform provides a marketplace where, among other
          things, persons who seek transportation to certain destinations
          (“Riders”) can be matched with transportation options to such
          destinations. One option for Riders is to request a ride from
          rideshare drivers who are driving to or through those destinations
          (“Drivers”). Drivers, Riders, and any other individuals, excluding any
          Excluded Individuals, using the FareShare Platform are collectively
          referred to herein as “Users,” and the driving services provided by
          Drivers to Riders, and other transportation-related services provided
          by Drivers in connection with the FareShare Platform, shall be
          referred to herein as “Rideshare Services.” “FareShare Services” shall
          include any service provided by FareShare pursuant to the FareShare
          Platform (for clarity, FareShare Services does not include Rideshare
          Services or Third-Party Services).
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          As a User, you authorize FareShare to match and/or re-match you with
          Drivers or Riders based on factors such as your location, the
          requested pickup location, the estimated time to pickup, your
          destination, User preferences, ride mode, driver mode, membership
          status, regulatory or other third-party requirements, user statistics,
          and platform efficiency, and to cancel an existing match based on the
          same or other considerations. Any decision by a User to offer or
          accept Rideshare Services is a decision made in such User’s sole
          discretion. A separate agreement is formed between Drivers and Riders
          when the Rider accepts the Rideshare Services offered by the Driver.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          As used herein, “Excluded Individuals” means any individual who is
          registering to use the FareShare Platform or whose use of the
          FareShare Platform is on behalf of an organization contracted with
          FareShare, except as a Rider or Driver.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Your use of FareShare Services through the FareShare Platform may be
          subject to additional agreements between you and FareShare as
          applicable to the particular service in the particular market
          (“Supplemental Agreements”). Please review any applicable Supplemental
          Agreements carefully.{" "}

            IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A

          In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the terms and
          conditions of any Supplemental Agreement, the terms of this Agreement
          shall control, unless such Supplemental Agreement specifically states
          otherwise.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">2. Modification to the Agreement</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">
          FareShare reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of
          this Agreement, and such modifications shall be binding on you only
          upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Continued use of the
          FareShare Platform after any such changes shall constitute your
          acceptance of such changes. Unless material changes are made to the
          arbitration provisions herein, you agree that modification of this
          Agreement does not create a renewed opportunity to opt out of
          arbitration (if applicable).
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">3. Eligibility</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">
          The FareShare Platform may only be used by individuals who have the
          right and authority to enter into this Agreement and are fully able
          and competent to satisfy the terms, conditions, and obligations
          herein. The FareShare Platform is not available to Users who have had
          their User account temporarily or permanently deactivated. You may not
          allow other persons to use your User account, you agree that you are
          the sole authorized user of your User account, and you may not use
          your User account on behalf of any third party, except as otherwise
          expressly permitted by FareShare. To use the FareShare Platform, each
          User shall create a User account. Each person may only create one User
          account, and FareShare reserves the right to deactivate any additional
          or duplicate accounts. Your participation in certain FareShare
          programs and use of certain FareShare services may be subject to
          additional eligibility requirements as determined by FareShare.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          By becoming a User, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18
          years old. Individuals under the age of 18 are not permitted to create
          FareShare User or Driver accounts. Persons found to have done so will
          be deactivated immediately. Any use of the FareShare Platform must be
          by an adult 18 years or older. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you
          are the parent or legal guardian of a 16- or 17-year-old minor, you
          may not create a User account for such minor to use the FareShare
          Platform.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">4. Charges</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          As a User, you understand that request or use of Rideshare Services,
          FareShare Services, or Third-Party Services may result in charges
          (“Charges”) to you and/or to an organization, if applicable. Charges
          to Riders and/or organizations, if applicable, for Rideshare Services
          include Fares (defined below) and other applicable fees, tolls,
          surcharges, and taxes, plus any tips to the Driver that you elect to
          pay. FareShare has the authority and reserves the right to determine
          and modify pricing quoting to you a price for a specific ride at the
          time you make a request. Pricing may vary based on the type of service
          you request as described within the FareShare Platform. You are
          responsible for reviewing the price quote within the FareShare
          Platform and shall be responsible for all Charges incurred under your
          User account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the
          amounts thereof.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
          Rideshare Service Fares (“Fares”)
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">There are two types of Fares, quoted and variable.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Quoted Fares.</strong> When you make a ride request using
            the FareShare Platform, FareShare will quote to you a Fare at the
            time of your request. The quote is subject to change until the ride
            request is confirmed. If your destination is not the same as the
            destination in your ride request, or the time or distance of your
            ride differs substantially from your quoted fare, or if you attempt
            to abuse the FareShare Platform, we may, at FareShare’s sole
            discretion and determination, cancel the fare quote and charge you a
            variable fare as described below. FareShare does not guarantee that
            the quoted fare price will be equal to a variable fare for the same
            ride. Quoted fares may include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other
            Charges below, as applicable.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Variable Fares.</strong> Variable fares consist of a base
            charge and incremental charges based on the time and distance of
            your ride. For particularly short rides, minimum fares may apply.
            Please note that we use GPS data from your Driver’s phone to
            calculate the distance traveled on your ride. We cannot guarantee
            the availability or accuracy of GPS data. If we lose signal, we will
            calculate time and distance using available data from your ride. In
            addition to the variable fare, the total cost of your ride may
            include the Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges below, as
            applicable.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Rideshare Service Fees and Other Charges
        </h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Service Fee.</strong> FareShare may charge a “Service Fee”
            for each ride.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Peak Time.</strong> At certain times, including times of
            high demand for Rideshare Services (“Peak Time”), you acknowledge
            that Charges may increase substantially. For quoted fares, we may
            factor Peak Time increases into the quoted price of the ride.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Priority Pickup and Wait & Save.</strong> In some cases, you
            may be able to select an expected pick-up that is faster or slower
            than standard for a higher or lower Fare, respectively.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Cancellation Fee.</strong> After requesting a ride, you may
            cancel it through the FareShare Platform, but note that in certain
            cases a cancellation fee may apply. FareShare may also charge a fee
            if you fail to show up after requesting a ride.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Damage Fee.</strong> If a Driver reports that you have
            materially damaged the Driver's vehicle, you agree to pay a “Damage
            Fee” of up to $250 depending on the extent of the damage (as
            determined by FareShare in its sole discretion), towards vehicle
            repair or cleaning. FareShare reserves the right (but is not
            obligated) to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages
            prior to processing the Damage Fee.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Abuse Fee.</strong> If we receive a credible report that you
            have misused or abused the FareShare Platform, you agree to pay an
            “Abuse Fee” of up to $250 as determined by FareShare in its sole
            discretion. FareShare reserves the right (but is not obligated) to
            verify or otherwise require documentation of abuse prior to
            processing the Abuse Fee.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Tolls.</strong> In some instances, tolls, toll estimates, or
            return tolls may apply to your ride. We do not guarantee that the
            amount charged by FareShare will match the toll charged to the
            Driver, if any.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Other Charges.</strong> Other fees and surcharges may apply
            to your ride, including, but not limited to: actual or anticipated
            airport fees, state fees, local fees, event fees, fuel surcharges,
            wait time fees, or distance surcharges as determined by FareShare or
            its marketing partners. In addition, where required by law FareShare
            will collect applicable taxes.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Tips.</strong> Following a ride, you may have the
            opportunity to elect to tip your Driver in cash or through a desired
            method of your and your driver's choosing. The FareShare Platform
            does not offer tip options through the FareShare Platform. It is the
            Driver's sole responsibility to keep track of tips they receive and
            report tips earned when filing their taxes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Charges Generally</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Facilitation of Charges.</strong> All Charges are
            facilitated through a third-party payment processor. FareShare may
            replace its third-party payment processor without notice to you.
            Apart from tips and funds deposited in the In-App Wallet of
            FareShare, cash payments are strictly prohibited unless expressly
            permitted by FareShare. Your payment of Charges to FareShare
            satisfies your payment obligation for your use of the FareShare
            Platform, FareShare Services, Third-Party Services, and Rideshare
            Services. Certain Charges may be collectively billed as a single
            purchase transaction to your selected payment method based on the
            payment frequency indicated in your settings. If your primary
            payment method expires, is invalid, or if Charges to your primary
            payment method are unable to be processed for whatever reason, then
            you agree that FareShare may charge your other available payment
            methods in the FareShare Platform. If you don't recognize a
            transaction, then check your ride receipts and payment history.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>No Refunds.</strong> All Charges are non-refundable except
            to the extent required by law. This no-refund policy shall apply at
            all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the
            FareShare Platform, any disruption to the FareShare Platform,
            FareShare Services, Third-Party Services, or Rideshare Services, or
            any other reason whatsoever.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>In-App Wallet.</strong> You may deposit funds in your In-App
            Wallet which you can apply toward payment of certain Charges. Funds
            in the In-App Wallet are valid only for use on the FareShare
            Platform and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as
            required by law. If the cost of your Charges exceeds the applicable
            In-App Wallet value, we may charge your payment method on file for
            the Charges in excess of the In-App Wallet amount. With respect to
            Fares, FareShare may deduct the amount attributable to the Service
            Fee, Tolls, or Other Charges before application of the In-App
            Wallet.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Supplemental Charges.</strong> Charges related to FareShare
            Services may be further detailed in the applicable Supplemental
            Agreement.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Third-Party Charges.</strong> If you choose to purchase
            Third-Party Services (described further in Section 20) through the
            FareShare Platform, you authorize your payment method on file to be
            charged according to the pricing terms set by FareShare or the
            third-party provider, or as otherwise provided in the terms of the
            purchased services.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-2">
            <strong>Payment Card Authorization.</strong> Upon addition of a new
            payment method or each request for FareShare Services, Rideshare
            Services, or Third-Party Services, FareShare may seek authorization
            of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure
            the Charges will be covered, and protect against unauthorized
            behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce
            your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s
            next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed
            the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to
            overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid
            card. FareShare is not responsible for these charges and is unable
            to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank.

        <p class="mb-4">
          For clarity, FareShare does not charge a fee for Users to access the

          organizations, if applicable, a fee or any other Charge for accessing
          or using FareShare Services, Rideshare Services, or Third-Party
          Services made available through the FareShare Platform.

          5. Driver Payments and Administrative Fees
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          If you are a Driver, you will receive payment for your provision of
          Rideshare Services, specifically, one-hundred percent (100%) of the
          Fare and optional passenger tips. Further, you will receive a
          recurring bonus from Driver(s) that you caused, through a referral, to
          become a Driver in connection with the FareShare Platform upon their
          completion of a 30-day probationary period on the FareShare Platform.
          However, if one of those Drivers does not pay their Administrative
          fee, you will not receive a recurring bonus for that Driver. Drivers
          agree to automatically be charged administrative fees weekly to gain
          access to the FareShare Platform. Drivers who fail to pay their weekly
          administrative fees will immediately have their account deactivated
          and they must reapply to drive for the FareShare Platform. Drivers
          also acknowledge and agree that the FareShare Platform can increase or
          decrease administrative fees with or without prior written notice.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">6. FareShare Communications</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          By entering into this Agreement or using the FareShare Platform, you
          agree to receive communications from us, our affiliates, or our
          third-party partners, at any of the phone numbers provided to
          FareShare by you or on your behalf, and via email, text message,
          calls, and push notifications. You agree that texts, calls, or
          prerecorded messages may be generated by automatic telephone dialing
          systems. Communications from FareShare, its affiliated companies,
          and/or Drivers may include but are not limited to: operational
          communications concerning your User account or use of the FareShare
          Platform, FareShare Services, Third-Party Services, or Rideshare
          Services, updates concerning new and existing features on the
          FareShare Platform, communications concerning marketing or promotions
          run by us or our third-party partners, and news concerning FareShare
          and industry developments. If you change or deactivate the phone
          number you provided to FareShare, you agree to update your User
          account information to help prevent us from inadvertently
          communicating with anyone who acquires your old number. Standard text

          YOU AND FARESHARE MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE OUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO
          RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE
          TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY ARBITRATION, as set forth below. This
          agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the
          Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”); but if the FAA is inapplicable for
          any reason, then this Arbitration Agreement is governed by the laws of
          the State of Texas, without regard to choice of law principles. This
          Arbitration Agreement survives after the Agreement terminates or your
          relationship with FareShare ends. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
          WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS

          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the
          Arbitration Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you
          and FareShare agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of
          others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”),
          California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration,

          including under the California PAGA, both you and FareShare agree that
          any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual
          basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been
          aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an
          action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other
          individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve

          Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement shall
          be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
          pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules that are in effect at the
          time the arbitration is initiated, as modified by the terms set forth

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-6">
          <li>
            1. If FareShare initiates arbitration under this Arbitration
            Agreement, FareShare will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.
          </li>
          <li>
            2. With respect to any Claims brought by FareShare against a Driver,
            or for Claims brought by a Driver against FareShare that: (A) are
            based on an alleged employment relationship between FareShare and a
            Driver; (B) arise out of, or relate to, FareShare’s actual
            deactivation of a Driver’s User account or a threat by FareShare to
            deactivate a Driver’s User account; (C) arise out of, or relate to,
            FareShare’s actual termination of a Driver’s Agreement with
            FareShare under the termination provisions of this Agreement, or a
            threat by FareShare to terminate a Driver’s Agreement; (D) arise out
            of, or relate to, Fares (as defined in this Agreement, including
            FareShare’s commission or fees on the Fares), tips, or average
            hourly guarantees owed by FareShare to Drivers for Rideshare
            Services, other than disputes relating to referral bonuses, other
            FareShare promotions, or consumer-type disputes, or (E) arise out of
            or relate to background checks performed in connection with a user
            seeking to become a Driver (the subset of Claims in subsections
            (A)-(E) shall be collectively referred to as “Driver Claims”),
            FareShare shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to
            the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including
            the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses (to the
            extent not paid by FareShare pursuant to the fee provisions above).
            However, if you are the party initiating the Driver Claim, you shall
            be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing
            fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general
            jurisdiction in the state in which you provide Rideshare Services to
            Riders, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you pursuant to
            the AAA Rules, applicable law, or subsection (e)(1) above. Any
            dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be
            resolved by the arbitrator. For purposes of this Section 17(e)(2),
            the term “Driver” shall be deemed to include both Drivers and Driver
            applicants who have not been approved to drive.
          </li>
          <li>
            3. Except as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 or any
            state equivalents, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and
            pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs
            that each party would incur if the claim(s) were litigated in a
            court such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take
            depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents,
            etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            4. At the end of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award
            reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to you if you
            prevail, to the extent authorized by applicable law.

        <p class="mb-4">
          You agree not to use any technical, financial, strategic and other
          proprietary and confidential information relating to FareShare’s
          business, operations and properties, information about a User made
          available to you in connection with such User’s use of the FareShare
          Platform, which may include the User’s name, pick-up location, contact
          information and photo (“Confidential Information”) disclosed to you by
          FareShare for your own use or for any purpose other than as
          contemplated herein. You shall not disclose or permit disclosure of
          any Confidential Information to third parties, and you agree not to
          store separate and outside of the FareShare Platform any Confidential
          Information obtained from the FareShare Platform. As a Driver, you
          understand that some of the Confidential Information you receive may
          be protected by federal and/or state confidentiality laws, such as the
          Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
          (“HIPAA”), governing the privacy and security of protected (patient)
          health information. In the event that you know a Rider, you should not
          disclose to anyone the identity of the Rider or the location that you
          picked up, or dropped off the Rider, as this could violate HIPAA. You
          understand that any violation of the Agreement’s confidentiality
          provisions may violate HIPAA or state confidentiality laws and could
          result in civil or criminal penalties against you. You agree to take
          all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure
          or use of Confidential Information of FareShare in order to prevent it
          from falling into the public domain. Notwithstanding the above, you
          shall not have liability to FareShare with regard to any Confidential
          Information which you can prove: was in the public domain at the time
          it was disclosed by FareShare or has entered the public domain through
          no fault of yours; was known to you, without restriction, at the time
          of disclosure, as demonstrated by files in existence at the time of
          disclosure; is disclosed with the prior written approval of FareShare;
          becomes known to you, without restriction, from a source other than
          FareShare without breach of this Agreement by you and otherwise not in
          violation of FareShare’s rights; or is disclosed pursuant to the order
          or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other
          governmental body; provided, however, that you shall provide prompt
          notice of such court order or requirement to FareShare to enable
          FareShare to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent or restrict
          such disclosure.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">19. Relationship with FareShare</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">
          As a Driver on the FareShare Platform, you acknowledge and agree that
          you and FareShare are in a direct business relationship, and the
          relationship between the parties under this Agreement is solely that
          of independent contracting parties. You and FareShare expressly agree
          that (1) this is not an employment agreement and does not create an
          employment relationship between you and FareShare; and (2) no joint
          venture, franchisor-franchisee, partnership, or agency relationship is
          intended or created by this Agreement. You have no authority to bind
          FareShare, and you undertake not to hold yourself out as an employee,
          agent or authorized representative of FareShare.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          FareShare does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you
          generally or in your performance under this Agreement specifically,
          including in connection with your provision of Rideshare Services,
          your acts or omissions, or your operation and maintenance of your
          vehicle. You retain the sole right to determine when, where, and for
          how long you will utilize the FareShare Platform. FareShare does not,
          and shall not be deemed to, unilaterally prescribe specific dates,
          times of day, or any minimum number of hours for you to utilize the
          FareShare Platform. You retain the option to accept or to decline or
          ignore a Rider’s request for Rideshare Services via the FareShare
          Platform, or to cancel an accepted request for Rideshare Services via
          the FareShare Platform, subject to FareShare’s then-current
          cancellation policies. FareShare does not, and shall not be deemed to,
          require you to accept any specific request for Rideshare Services as a
          condition of maintaining access to the platform. With the exception of
          any signage required by law or permit/license rules or requirements,
          FareShare shall have no right to require you to:

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You acknowledge and agree that you have complete discretion to provide
          Rideshare Services or otherwise engage in any other business or
          employment activities, including but not limited to providing services
          similar to the Rideshare Services to other companies, and that
          FareShare does not, and shall not be deemed to, restrict you from
          engaging in any such activity.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">20. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">
          In addition to connecting Riders with Drivers, the FareShare Platform
          may enable Users to provide services or receive services from other
          third parties (“Third-Party Services”). This Agreement between you and
          FareShare governs your use of the FareShare Platform in connection
          with the Third-Party Services.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In addition, you understand that the Third-Party Services may also be
          subject to terms and pricing of the third-party provider
          (collectively, the “Third-Party Terms”) which will govern your
          relationship with such third-party provider, as applicable. You agree
          that FareShare is not responsible and may not be held liable for the
          Third-Party Services or the actions or omissions of the third-party
          provider. Such Third-Party Services may not be investigated, monitored
          or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by
          FareShare, and FareShare is not responsible for any Third-Party
          Services accessed through the FareShare Platform.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          In the event of a conflict in the terms of any Third-Party Terms and
          this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control with respect
          to FareShare and your agreements with FareShare herein, and the
          limitations of liability set forth in Section 15 above shall also
          apply to the third party provider. The Dispute Resolution and
          Arbitration Agreement provisions in Section 17 above shall apply
          instead of any terms in any Third-Party Terms for all purposes except
          with respect to claims that are solely against the third-party
          provider.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">21. General</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Except as provided in Section 17, this Agreement shall be governed by
          the laws of the State of Texas without regard to choice of law
          principles. This choice of law provision is only intended to specify
          the use of Texas law to interpret this Agreement and is not intended
          to create any other substantive right to non-Texans to assert claims
          under Texas law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. If any
          provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non-binding, the
          parties shall remain bound by all other provisions of this Agreement.
          In that event, the parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding
          provision with provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to
          the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the invalid or
          non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of this
          Agreement. You agree that this Agreement and all incorporated
          agreements may be automatically assigned by FareShare, in our sole
          discretion by providing notice to you. You may not assign this
          Agreement without FareShare’s prior written approval. Any purported
          assignment by you in violation of this section shall be void. This
          Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between
          you and FareShare with respect to the subject matter hereof and
          supersedes all previous understandings and agreements between the
          parties, whether oral or written.
