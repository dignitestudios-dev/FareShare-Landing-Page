        <p class="mb-4">
          This policy applies to all FareShare users, including Riders and
          Drivers (including Driver applicants), and to all FareShare platforms
          and services, including our applications, websites, technology,
          facilities, and other services (collectively, the “FareShare
          Platform”). This policy applies only to personal information, not to
          aggregate information or information that does not identify you.
          Please remember that your use of the FareShare Platform is also
          subject to our Terms of Service.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2. The Information We Collect</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          When you use the FareShare Platform, we collect the information you
          provide, usage information, and information about your device. We also
          collect information about you from other sources like service
          providers, and optional programs in which you participate, which we
          may combine with other information we have about you. Here are the
          types of information we collect about you:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">
          A. Information You Provide to Us
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Account Registration. When you create an account with FareShare, we
          collect the information you provide us, such as your name, email
          address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, and payment
          information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your
          Rider profile, like saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up
          other preferences. We may ask that you provide additional information
          related to the identity of your account, such as documents related to
          identification (e.g., driver’s license), a profile picture, or
          “selfie” imagery. If you choose to engage in additional offerings on
          the FareShare Platform, you may provide us additional information
          relevant to those offerings.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Driver Information. If you apply to be a Driver, we will collect the
          information you provide in your application, including your name,
          email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, physical
          address, government identification number (such as social security
          number), driver’s license information, vehicle information, and car
          insurance information. We collect the payment information you provide
          us, including your bank routing numbers, and tax information.
          Depending on where you want to drive, we may also ask for additional
          business license or permit information or other information to manage
          driving and programs relevant to that location. We may need additional
          information from you at some point after you become a Driver,
          including information to confirm your identity (like “selfie”
          imagery).{" "}

        <p class="mb-4">

          (including about Riders or Drivers), we collect all of the information
          you provide in your feedback.

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Communications</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          When you contact us or we contact you, including through surveys or

          B. Information We Collect When You Use the FareShare Platform
        </h3>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Location Information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The FareShare Platform collects location information (including GPS
          and Wi-Fi data, IP address, and Bluetooth data) differently depending
          on your FareShare app settings and device permissions as well as
          whether you are using the platform as a Rider or Driver:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Riders:</strong> We collect your device’s precise location
            when you open and use the FareShare app, including while the app is
            running in the background from the time you request a ride until it
            ends.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Drivers:</strong> We collect your device’s precise location
            when you open and use the app, including while the app is running in
            the background. We also collect precise location for a limited time
            after you exit driver mode in order to detect ride incidents, and
            continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no
            longer active. If you choose to install a FareShare Platform device
            in or on your vehicle (e.g., a FareShare dashboard device or
            tablet), that device may collect precise location information when
            turned on.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Usage Information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We collect information about your use of the FareShare Platform,
          including ride information like the date, time, destination, distance,
          route, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code.
          We also collect information about your interactions with the FareShare
          Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and content
          you view and the dates and times of your use. We may also infer
          information from your use of or information you provide us in your
          interactions with the FareShare Platform.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Device Information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We collect information about the devices you use to access the
          FareShare Platform, including device model, IP address, type of
          browser, version of operating system, identity of carrier and
          manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings (such
          as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers,
          advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. If you are a
          Driver, we also collect mobile sensor data from your device (such as
          speed, direction, height, acceleration, deceleration, and other
          technical data). If you have installed a FareShare Platform device in
          your vehicle (e.g., a FareShare dashboard device or tablet), that
          device may similarly collect sensor data and other information like
          location, as described when you choose and set up such devices.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Address Book Contacts</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You may set your device permissions to grant FareShare access to your
          contact lists and direct FareShare to access your contact list, for
          example to help you refer friends to FareShare. If you choose to do
          this, we will access the names and contact information of the people
          in your address book.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Calendar Information</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          You may set your device permissions or otherwise grant FareShare
          access to your chosen calendar and direct FareShare to access calendar
          information, for example to help you get alerts to order a ride for
          your upcoming trip. If you choose to do this, we will access and store
          information available in your calendar to use in providing you these
          optional features.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">
          Cookies, Analytics, and Third-Party Technologies
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We collect information through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels,
          data analytics tools like Google Analytics, SDKs, and other
          third-party technologies to understand how you navigate through the
          FareShare Platform and interact with FareShare advertisements, to make
          your FareShare experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to
          improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites,
          and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files that web
          servers place on your device; they are designed to store basic
          information and to help websites and apps recognize your browser. We
          may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie
          disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains
          after you close your browser and may be accessed every time you use
          the FareShare Platform.

          providers to make the FareShare Platform work and to deliver relevant
          personalized ads to you on and off the FareShare Platform. Some of

          A. Sharing Between FareShare Users
        </h3>

        <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mb-2">Riders and Drivers</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Rider information shared with Driver: As part of surfacing the ride
          request and enabling the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider’s
          pickup and destination, location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider
          statistics, and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile
          as well as any additional stops the Rider inputs into the FareShare
          app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s
          rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider’s identity
          associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers,
          but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the
          rating or feedback.)
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Driver information shared with Rider: Upon a Driver accepting a
          requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver’s name,
          profile photo, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make,
          model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the
          Driver’s FareShare profile, such as information Drivers choose to add
          and Driver statistics.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to

          Shared Ride Riders: When Riders use a FareShare Shared ride, we share
          each Rider’s name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may
          also see each other’s pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing
          the route while sharing the ride.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Rides Requested or Paid For by Others: Some rides you take may be
          requested or paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using
          your FareShare Business Profile account; a pass, code or coupon; a
          subsidized program (e.g., transit or government); a corporate credit
          card linked to another account; or another user or entity otherwise
          requests or pays for a ride (or portion of a ride) for you, we may
          share some or all of your ride details with that other party,
          including your identity (e.g., name, phone number), the date, time,
          charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off
          location of your ride.

          FareShare Platform as part of a FareShare Family account linked with
          others or if you direct us to share your information with trusted
          contacts, we will then share with those parties information about your
          use of the FareShare Platform, such as the live location of your ride.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Referral Programs: If you refer someone to the FareShare Platform, we
          will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user
          referred you, we may share information about your use of the FareShare
          Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a
          bonus when you join the FareShare Platform or complete a certain
          number of rides and would receive such information.
